# HAND_GESTURE_RECOGNITION
A deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures from images or video data. This project enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
âœ¨ Features
High Accuracy: CNN-based model achieving over 90% validation accuracy

Real-time Prediction: Webcam-based gesture recognition with live feedback

Hand Detection: Integrated MediaPipe for robust hand detection and tracking

Multiple Gestures: Supports 10 different hand gestures

Easy Training: Comprehensive training pipeline with callbacks and monitoring
